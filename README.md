# makeshells
Alternate makeshells in python and v (https://github.com/vlang/v)

Here are examples of using something other than bash in GNU make recipes.
The python example is comple and usable for C++ projects (Auto generates deps and rules, etc, creates seperate builds for lib, test, and exe.)

T v example is a proof of concept to show it can be done in v as well, but the v makeshell is not really usable yet for software projects.
